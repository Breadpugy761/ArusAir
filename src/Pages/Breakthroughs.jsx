      	While our invention in a way does exist, for our interpretation there is something that roadblocks our efforts: membranes. While we can create them, we need to make them cheaper to build and make them into durable, functional sheets. 

        To successfully create our product, we need breakthroughs in technology. One such breakthrough is finding a cheap way to bio-engineer a single celled organism, that doesn’t need many nutrients, that’s large enough, and durable enough to survive mild conditions, and be pressed into a tiled grid. This organism should be able to collect enough water from the air so it can “drown” by getting too much water. These single-celled organisms should give us our hydrophilic membrane sheet, because all cells have membranes

        To test our ExploraVision project we will have to test how much water the machine can collect with and without the Single-Celled organisms to do this we will probably leave it either on the coast of the pacific, by the shore of the or depending on the model, on the mainland. We will also chart how much water the membranes collect with different layer counts. Such as, a small single celled organism, or large tough single-celled organisms.
