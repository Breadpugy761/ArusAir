    	  Water is one of the most valuable and immense resources in the entire world. People depend on this resource to live and survive in this world. And while a big 71 percent of the world is covered in this resource, not all of it can be used for consumption, only about 2.5 percent. Because of the scarcity of drinkable water some people donâ€™t have easy access to it but people for a long time have been trying to fix this problem in their own ways and while these ideas have had varying amounts of success, our invention is sure to be just as effective. Introducing our invention, Arus. This invention takes the precipitation in the air and converts it into clean drinking water, saving you time and money. </p> <p style={{fontSize: "18px",}}>
        The first mechanic that we are planning on possibly using is cell membranes. You can harvest and collect water from these cell membranes because they attract tons of water, making an absurdly hydroscopic surface, and while we are still researching hydroscopic surfaces, cell membranes seem to be able to collect around 23 liters of water/ day, with no electricity cost. These cell membranes self-constructed, meaning that they can construct into a hydroscopic surface all on their own. This topic is extremely complex and is still being researched in labs. Also, this option might not be that cost-effective, and we might have to go find an alternative hydroscopic surface material. </p> <p style={{fontSize: "18px",}}>
	      A second but simpler principle that is used is Condensation. Condensation is commonly known as one of the parts of the Rain Cycle. It occurs when evaporated water reaches a high elevation, which has cooler temperatures, causing the gas to return to liquid form. We can mimic this by having a cooler in our machine, which cools down some of the vapor that we manage to grab. Using a hygroscopic surface, that can be applied here to, to speed up collection of water molecules, for the water molecules will be both too heavy to stay in the air, and get pulled out of the air, onto the surface by the cell membranes at the same time, causing it to quickly stick to the surface, and runoff.
        Our idea is especially important to those who do not have easy access to drinking water, compared to other parts of the world like the United States. The Messiah helps combat this by being an easy way to get drinking water, as it can be harnessed from thin air, as if it was magic. </p>
