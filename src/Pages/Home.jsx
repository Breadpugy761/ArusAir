      <p>Our invention is called Aurus Air or water current in English. It takes the precipitation of the air and turns it into drinkable water. For communities that struggle to get enough water this invention will help them grow and thrive. Our invention contains membrane sheets that attract water molecules which then condense into water. Our invention can make around 80-120 liters of water a day. We hope that this invention will reach people that donâ€™t have easy access to water.</p></div>
